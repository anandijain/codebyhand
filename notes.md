to make it actually work:
    - train conv net on whatever data is out there
    - bounding box detection for characters to rescale to pretrained
    - probably want to include an nlp model that predicts the next word


use cases:
    - vscode utility to easily match handwriting predictions with intellij


gtrans handwriting tool spec:

    ~10 suggestions, punctuation to start
    ~ backspace
    ~ space
    ~ enter
    ~ unique icon when hovering/writing
